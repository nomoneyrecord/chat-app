## Summary

The purpose of this application was to gain experience with developing a fully functional messaging app utilizing a database, APIs, web tokens for authentication, and using multiple technologies to build the logic for how users can communicate in realtime. This was an exciting and challenging app with learning the power and neccessity for SQL and building databases that utilize tables, rows, and columns to create storage, structure, and reference points. This build also focuses on the fundamentals of web tokens and creating strong authentication for security and proper references to data and tables to be able to store user information locally and in a specified database. And of course, the primary focus was building a forever and continous foundation to problem solving, chunking, and debugging.
